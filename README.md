# Hi there, I'm Manish! ðŸ‘‹

I am a final-year Computer Engineering Student at the Don Bosco Institute of Technology. I am a CyberSecurity enthusiast and eager to enter the field. In my college, I have opted for the Honours degree in CyberSecurity to learn new and exciting things. 
I take up courses and practice on TryHAckMe and HackTheBox Platforms to keep me updated with advancements in Cyber-Security. I practice competitive programming to solve problems in the most convenient way. I practice it on platforms like Leetcode and HackerRank. I have also won a few Coding Competitions organised at my college.
I have participated in Smart India Hackathon Finale 2022 where we build a python and javascript-based desktop application. I have 2 Unity-based Android games named RescueBud and Astro Expedition published on Google PlayStore with a total of 500+ downloads.
